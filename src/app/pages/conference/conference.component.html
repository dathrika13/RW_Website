                    represented by our ESG Technical Manager, Ben Fernando. Ben attended many wonderful presentations

                        growing with exciting new developments in the US and EU that facilitate waste reduction, reuse,
                        and sustainable procurement practices.</b>

                        nations, sectors, and company functions. Every stakeholder, from policymakers to consumers, is
                        important in this effort.</b>

                        decisions requires robust data collection and analysis. Tools such as lifecycle assessments
